/// A dialog kept off the iPhone Duo's fold, as Apple asks: under a fold that
/// runs across the screen (the Duo open upright, or stood half open as a
/// tabletop), where sheets open too, and in the end half beside one that
/// runs down it (open on its side). The part of the screen it is given is
/// its window, so a dialog that lays itself out by the window's shape — a
/// date picker turns on its side — fits it. Anywhere else, and where iOS
/// says nothing of a fold, [child] as it is.
///
/// Wrap what a dialog's builder returns:
///
/// ```dart
/// showDialog(
///   context: context,
///   builder: (context) => DialogOffFold(child: AlertDialog(...)),
/// );
/// ```
