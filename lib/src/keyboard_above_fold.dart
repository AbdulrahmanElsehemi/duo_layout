/// sit on the bend. While the keyboard is up, this tells every screen under
/// it that the keyboard reaches the fold: pages and sheets then keep the
/// field above it, the way a laptop has the screen above and the keys below.
/// Without a fold across the screen, or with no keyboard, [child] as it is.
