/// open on a table ([DuoPosture.tabletop]): [top] on the upright half, where
/// it is watched (a photo, a video, a map), and [bottom] on the half lying
/// flat, where it is touched (the details, the controls). The fold and its
/// margins between them stay empty, as Apple asks.

/// Held any other way, and off the Duo, it is [child]: the page as usual.
/// The posture comes from the hinge, but this rebuilds only when it changes,
/// not on every step of the hinge.

/// Each half is a window of its own: [MediaQuery] gives it its own size, and
/// the insets of the edge the fold cuts off are gone. The fold is in the
/// window's coordinates, so it is used only while this takes the window's
/// whole height: give it the Scaffold's body, not something inset.
///
/// Moving between [child] and the two halves builds them anew. Keep what
/// has to last (a scroll position, a pick) above this, or under a
/// `GlobalKey` both use.
