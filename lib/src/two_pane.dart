/// ([DuoDevice.fold]), so neither pane is broken by the crease and each is
/// about a phone wide; elsewhere, and where iOS says nothing, down the middle
/// — where the Duo folds anyway, and half and half on an iPad. The fold is

/// inset.

/// Each pane keeps clear of its own edge of the glass (the status bar down
/// one side, a camera), not the other pane's. Only the pane beside the status
/// bar gives its header's buttons to the column down it ([SideToolbar]); the
/// other keeps them above it, by the content they act on, as Apple's guide
/// for the iPhone Duo does.
